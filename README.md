# Vehicule_Autonome_3D_Need4Stek

This project is one of the most realistic project. Create your own AI into the circuits. 😎

The goal of the project is to create AI with the most performance and that allows the car of forward the fastest as many possible before the length of time allotted. 😃

Your goal is to create a AI that be maintainable in the time of the circuit but that don't too much consequence for the car. 😁

But also you can build a proper circuit to your project as a bonus. 👌

We got the best grade either A 👀
